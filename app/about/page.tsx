        The leap from software engineering to entrepreneurship was a natural one
        for me. I&apos;ve always believed that technology has the power to
        transform lives, and I wanted to be at the forefront of that
        transformation. With a few crazy ideas and a lot of caffeine, I embarked
        on the journey of building my own company. It&apos;s been a
        rollercoaster of highs and lows, but I wouldn&apos;t trade the
        experience for the world. Every setback has been a lesson, and every
        success, a moment of pure joy.
