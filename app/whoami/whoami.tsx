        Hello! I am a Software Engineer for Workday, Inc specializing in front
        end development. The frameworks that I use most often are React and
        NextJs. When I create web applications I focus on user experience and
        simplicity. Currently I am aiming to leverage my skills and passion to
        transition into Full Stack Development. I founded Empowering Software
        which helps spreads the power of AI to non-tech professions by
        interviewing and creating resources for them. Of course there is life
        outside of work. I enjoy spending time outside hiking and camping. I
        love to hang out with my family and friends. There is not better way to
        end the end than being in a recovery center sitting in a cold tub.
