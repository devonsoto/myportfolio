        Hello! I am a Software Engineer for Workday, Inc specializing in front
        end development. The frameworks that I use most often are React and
        NextJs. When I create web applications I focus on user experience and
        ease of use. I also enjoy learning new technologies such as aws and
        chatgpt. Once the workday is over I enjoy spending time outside or at a
        recovery center sitting in a cold tub. Looking to work together? ðŸ‘‰
